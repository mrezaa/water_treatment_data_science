# Project Title

Water treatment center data mining

## Description

Here we are going to do some data prediction in the form of regression. With some rainfall and temerature data at hand plus water treatment refinery stats, 
we are going to predict some other data from refinery to have a clue for future water treatment. data from 5 years are used to do some regression model
train and test. 3 models used comprises of MLP neural net, random forest and gradient boosting. Although in most cased end up bad results, we would have 
some tolerable results base of R2 score for daily analysis versus monthly and weekly data analysis.

## Getting Started
